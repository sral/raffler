- API needs to be revisted once we build frontend
    - Inconsistent responses (always echo state?)
    - Accept formdata instead of json in?
- Refactor and separate API from DB somehow (stick DB in shared state? Move db implementation and pass transaction in?)
- Refactor db to re-use common queries etc... remove duplication... maybe... :reverse_shaking_fist:
- Learn how to deal with session/auth in Rocket
- Fix return values i.e. correct HTTP statuses
- Ditch Rocket and go for Actix?!
- SQLite seems to be a misstake, move to postgres at some point
    - Dealing with timestamps (sqlx?) are pure pain in sqlite apparently (NULL constraints)
    - Dont' forget to add locks
