- API needs to be revisted once we build frontend
    - Inconsistent responses (always echo state?)
    - Accept formdata instead of json in?
- Refactor and separate API from DB somehow (stick DB in shared state? Move db implementation and pass transaction in?)
- Refactor db to re-use common queries etc... remove duplication... maybe... :reverse_shaking_fist:
    - For a blatant example see disable/enable
- Learn how to deal with session/auth in Rocket
- Fix return values i.e. correct HTTP statuses
- Ditch Rocket and go for Actix?!
- SQLite seems to be a misstake, move to postgres at some point
    - Dealing with timestamps (sqlx?) are pure pain in sqlite apparently (NULL constraints)
    - Dont' forget to add locks
- There's currently no validation of actions on deleted entities. Ex you can add games to deleted locations
- UNIQUE constraint on location name makes no sense if you are re-adding (delete and recreate) the same location
- Queries have no ORDER BY i.e. ordering needs to be fixed
